# Exercise Internship Application
A month ago I applied for an internship in a company that was unfortunately looking for a student at the end of engineering school for a pre-employment internship. Before the interview, they asked me to code a live display of a soccer game from a Json file. I can't attach the file for obvious privacy reasons but I want to show the script that corresponds to my last exercise coded in python. I have always done functional programming but this exercise allowed me to apply the principles of object-oriented programming from the Java course of the beginning of the year.

As I was not chosen and had to provide the code in a very short time while I was studying, the code is little commented and can be greatly improved. I am working on a modification of the json file to be able to display at least the terrain on fixed positions.
